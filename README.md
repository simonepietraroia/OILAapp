### Design 
For the design I was given a shade of yellow, purple, white, and light blue. These colors serve to compliment the playful and simple shade of yellow in the application. These colors also seperate each section of the main page. The custom font and images are meant to be simple and familiy oriented to attract the desired audince 
1. Images
The hero image was selected to communicate directly what the service provided and the target audince of parents and children 9-5 years old.
2. Colour Scheme
The colors were used to seperate sections of the website and to match the application's color template
